I get the same behaviour with my Samsung Galaxy (Android 4). However, I found a workaround to get the commander app working with the EV3. Try the following steps.
 
1. Unpair the EV3 from the Android device in case they are paired.
2. Goto Bluetooth options on the Android an initiate Bluetooth pairing.
3. On EV3 accept the pairing request but don't enter the passcode yet
4. Start up the comannder app and choose the desired model.
5 On the EV3 enter the passcode (e.g. 1234).
6. On the Android enter the passcode as well (e.g. 1234).
7. Immediately press play in the commander app.
8. The commander app will change to the remote control screen instead of initiating another bluetooth pairing.
 
Unfortunately the above steps have to be repeated every time you start up the commander app or if you want the change the EV3 model.
